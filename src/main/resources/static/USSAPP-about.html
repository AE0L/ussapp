      <h3>About USSAPP</h3>
      <p>Unified Submission System for Academic Project Proposal (USAPP) was developed in 2021 by a group of Computer Science students at the Polytechnic University of the Philippines (PUP) with the purpose of convenience, portability, and faster communication of the Professors, Advisors, and other faculty members to students (vice versa) for Academic Submissions. USSAPP is an application used to submit and communicate regarding academic purposes.</p>
      <p>One of the main goals of USSAPP is convenience with easy and secured access to classes, professors, and other faculty members. Reducing the unnecessary steps for costly revisions and submissions, consequently adding more time for productivity.
Portability, the instant connection to advisors and faculty members to submit and communicate, is one of the best features of USSAPP. Compatible with most types of devices, USSAPP is the gold standard for safe and secure academic engagements.</p>
      <p>Faster communication. With this app, discussion with students to professors and vice versa made it easier to organize plans, organize academic papers, and other endeavors.</p>
      <p>USSAPP combines those goals that lead to the creation of this revolutionary app. A quick, easy, secured, and portable submission system that will benefit universities and nature by reducing excess wastes to save trees by reducing unnecessary use of excessive papers.</p>
